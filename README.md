Work Nest: Backend File Structure Explained
This document provides a detailed breakdown of the key files that make up the Django backend for the Work Nest application.

Analogy Key:
The Kitchen: The entire Django Backend.

The Pantry: The Database (SQLite/PostgreSQL).

The Waiter: The API (Django REST Framework).

The Recipes: The Models (models.py).

The Translator: The Serializers (serializers.py).

The Chef/Brains: The Views (views.py).

The Address Book: The URL files (urls.py).

1. backend/api/models.py
Purpose: This is the architectural blueprint for your database. It defines the structure of your data tables using Python classes.

What it does:

The Permission, User, and Task classes in this file directly correspond to the tables in your database.

Each field within a class (e.g., Task.title = models.CharField(...)) defines a column in that table, specifying its data type (CharField for text, IntegerField for numbers, etc.).

ForeignKey fields are used to create relationships between tables, such as linking a Task to the User who created it.

Analogy: These are The Recipes in the kitchen's recipe book. They define what ingredients (data) are needed for each dish (data object) and how they are structured.

2. backend/api/serializers.py
Purpose: To translate data between the complex Python objects used by Django and the simple JSON format used by web APIs.

What it does:

Takes data from a database query (a Python Task object) and converts it into JSON to be sent to the React frontend.

Takes incoming JSON data from a frontend request (like a new task being created) and converts it back into a Python object that can be saved to the database.

Analogy: This is The Translator. It ensures the customer's order (JSON from React) is understood by the kitchen (Python/Django) and that the finished dish (Python object) is presented in a way the customer can understand (JSON).

3. backend/api/views.py
Purpose: This is the core logic center of your API. It handles incoming requests, performs actions, and sends back responses.

What it does:

The TaskViewSet contains the custom logic for task creation.

The perform_create method is where you implemented the critical business rules: checking a user's can_assign permission and comparing their designation_level against the person they are assigning the task to.

It uses the TaskSerializer to handle data translation and interacts with the Task model to get or save data from the database.

Analogy: This is The Chef. The chef receives an order from the waiter, gets the ingredients from the pantry based on the recipe, cooks the dish (applies business logic), and gives the finished plate back to the waiter.

4. backend/api/urls.py & backend/backend/urls.py
Purpose: These files map specific web addresses (URLs) to the corresponding "brain" (View) that should handle them.

What they do:

api/urls.py: Defines all the API-specific URLs like /tasks/, /users/, and /token/. The DefaultRouter automatically creates a full set of URLs for each ViewSet (e.g., for listing, creating, deleting tasks).

backend/urls.py: This is the main entry point. It directs any traffic that starts with /api/ to the api/urls.py file to be handled there.

Analogy: This is The Address Book or phone directory for the kitchen. It tells the system which chef is responsible for which type of order.

5. backend/api/migrations/0003_seed_initial_data.py
Purpose: A special, one-time script used to populate a fresh database with essential starting data.

What it does:

This is a "data migration," not a "schema migration." It doesn't change the table structure; it only adds rows of data.

The script you wrote adds the default Permission levels, creates the initial set of users (manager, teamlead, etc.), and seeds the database with sample tasks.

Analogy: This is the Initial Stocking of the Pantry. Before the restaurant opens for the first time, this script ensures the pantry is filled with all the basic ingredients needed to start cooking.

6. backend/backend/settings.py
Purpose: The main configuration file for the entire Django project.

What it does:

Lists all INSTALLED_APPS (like rest_framework and our api app).

Configures the database connection.

Contains security settings, like the CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS which is crucial for allowing your React frontend to communicate with the backend.

Tells Django to use your custom User model instead of the default one (AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'api.User').

Analogy: This is the Restaurant's Management Office. It holds the operating license, the list of approved suppliers, the keys to the building, and the overall rules for how the restaurant should run.
